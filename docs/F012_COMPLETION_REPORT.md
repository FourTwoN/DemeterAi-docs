# F012 Completion Report - docker-compose.yml

## Card Information
- **Card ID**: F012
- **Title**: docker-compose.yml (Local Development Environment)
- **Sprint**: Sprint 00 (Foundation)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Status**: COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented complete Docker Compose orchestration for DemeterAI v2.0 local development environment. All services (PostgreSQL 18 + PostGIS 3.6, Redis 7, FastAPI API) start successfully with health checks, dependency ordering, and persistent volumes.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. docker-compose.yml
Created complete orchestration file with:

#### Active Services (3)
1. **db (PostgreSQL 18 + PostGIS 3.6)**
   - Image: postgis/postgis:18-3.6
   - Port: 5432
   - Volume: postgres_data (persistent)
   - Health check: pg_isready every 10s
   - Credentials: demeter/demeter_dev_password

2. **redis (Redis 7 Alpine)**
   - Image: redis:7-alpine
   - Port: 6379
   - Volume: redis_data (persistent)
   - Health check: redis-cli ping every 5s

3. **api (FastAPI Application)**
   - Build: From local Dockerfile
   - Port: 8000
   - Depends on: db (healthy), redis (healthy)
   - Health check: curl /health every 30s
   - Features: Auto-reload enabled (--reload)

#### Future Services (Commented, Sprint 02+)
- celery_cpu: CPU worker (prefork pool)
- celery_io: I/O worker (gevent pool)
- flower: Celery monitoring UI (port 5555)

### 2. Environment Configuration
Updated .env.example with:
- Redis configuration (REDIS_URL)
- Celery broker/backend URLs
- Database URLs (async + sync)

### 3. Dependency Addition
Added psycopg2-binary==2.9.10 to requirements.txt:
- Required for Alembic migrations (sync driver)
- Tested and verified working

### 4. Documentation
Created DOCKER_COMPOSE_GUIDE.md with:
- Quick start guide
- Service descriptions
- Common commands (up, ps, logs, down)
- Health check procedures
- Troubleshooting section
- Development workflow
- Production notes

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] **AC1**: docker-compose.yml created with all services (6 total: 3 active, 3 commented)
- [x] **AC2**: Health checks configured for all services
- [x] **AC3**: Dependency ordering with service_healthy conditions
- [x] **AC4**: Persistent volumes (postgres_data, redis_data)
- [x] **AC5**: Environment variables from .env
- [x] **AC6**: Commands work (up, ps, logs, down)
- [x] **AC7**: All services start successfully

## Testing Performed

### 1. Syntax Validation
```bash
docker compose config --quiet
# Result: Success (no output)
```

### 2. Service Startup
```bash
docker compose up -d
# Result: All 3 services started successfully
```

### 3. Health Checks
```bash
docker compose ps
# Result:
# - demeterai-db: healthy
# - demeterai-redis: healthy
# - demeterai-api: healthy
```

### 4. API Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Result: {"status":"healthy","service":"DemeterAI v2.0"}
```

### 5. Database Migrations
```bash
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head
# Result: Migration successful (initial_setup_enable_postgis applied)
```

### 6. Logging
```bash
docker compose logs api --tail=20
# Result: Logs visible with structured JSON format
```

### 7. Clean Shutdown
```bash
docker compose down
# Result: All services stopped and removed cleanly
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. `/home/lucasg/proyectos/DemeterDocs/docker-compose.yml` (162 lines)
2. `/home/lucasg/proyectos/DemeterDocs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_GUIDE.md` (365 lines)
3. `/home/lucasg/proyectos/DemeterDocs/.env` (from .env.example)

### Modified
1. `/home/lucasg/proyectos/DemeterDocs/.env.example` (uncommented Redis/Celery config)
2. `/home/lucasg/proyectos/DemeterDocs/requirements.txt` (added psycopg2-binary==2.9.10)

## Performance Metrics

### Startup Time
- Image pull (first time): ~90 seconds
- Service startup (subsequent): ~20 seconds
- Health checks complete: ~30 seconds
- Total time to ready: ~30 seconds (after images pulled)

### Service Health
- PostgreSQL ready: ~10 seconds
- Redis ready: ~5 seconds
- API ready: ~15 seconds (waits for db + redis)

### Resource Usage
- Containers: 3
- Volumes: 2 (persistent)
- Network: 1 (demeterai-network)
- Image sizes:
  - postgis/postgis:18-3.6: ~800MB
  - redis:7-alpine: ~40MB
  - demeterdocs-api: ~1.2GB

## Key Decisions

### 1. PostgreSQL 18 + PostGIS 3.6
- Original spec: 18-3.5 (not available)
- Solution: Used 18-3.6 (latest available)
- Reason: PostGIS 3.6 is backward compatible with 3.5

### 2. Celery Services Commented
- Original spec: Include all 6 services
- Solution: Commented celery_cpu, celery_io, flower
- Reason: app/celery_app.py not yet implemented (Sprint 02+)
- Note: TODO comments added for easy enablement

### 3. psycopg2-binary Addition
- Issue: Alembic failed with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'"
- Solution: Added psycopg2-binary==2.9.10 to requirements.txt
- Reason: Alembic requires sync driver, asyncpg not sufficient

### 4. Version Field Removed
- Issue: docker-compose warned "version attribute is obsolete"
- Solution: Removed version: '3.8' line
- Reason: Docker Compose V2 doesn't require version field

## Known Limitations

1. **Development Only**
   - Hardcoded passwords in docker-compose.yml
   - No SSL/TLS
   - No resource limits
   - Not suitable for production

2. **Celery Services**
   - Currently commented out
   - Requires app/celery_app.py (Sprint 02+)
   - Must be manually uncommented after implementation

3. **No GPU Support**
   - GPU workers not included
   - Requires NVIDIA Docker runtime
   - Will be added in production deployment (Sprint 04+)

4. **Single Database**
   - No read replicas
   - No failover
   - Production will use managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Sprint 01)
- [ ] All developers test: `docker compose up -d`
- [ ] Verify migrations work on all machines
- [ ] Update team onboarding documentation

### Sprint 02 (Celery Implementation)
- [ ] Create app/celery_app.py
- [ ] Uncomment celery_cpu, celery_io, flower in docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Test Celery task execution
- [ ] Verify Flower monitoring UI

### Sprint 04 (Production Deployment)
- [ ] Create docker-compose.prod.yml
- [ ] Add secrets management (Docker secrets)
- [ ] Configure resource limits
- [ ] Add nginx reverse proxy
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS

### Sprint 05 (Monitoring)
- [ ] Uncomment Prometheus service
- [ ] Uncomment Grafana service
- [ ] Configure monitoring dashboards

## Dependencies Unblocked

With F012 complete, the following are now possible:

1. **All Sprint 01 Development**
   - Developers can run full stack locally
   - Database migrations work
   - API development can begin

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Real database + Redis available
   - End-to-end testing possible
   - No mocking required

3. **Service Layer Development (Sprint 01-02)**
   - S001-S042 can be implemented
   - Real database for testing
   - Async connection pooling available

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always Check Image Availability**
   - postgis/postgis:18-3.5 didn't exist
   - Check Docker Hub before specifying versions
   - Use latest stable release

2. **Alembic Requires Sync Driver**
   - asyncpg alone is not sufficient
   - psycopg2-binary must be included
   - Both drivers needed (async for app, sync for migrations)

3. **Pre-commit Hooks Matter**
   - Caught trailing whitespace
   - Ensured consistent formatting
   - Good practice for team collaboration

4. **Health Checks Critical**
   - Prevents race conditions
   - Ensures proper startup order
   - Makes debugging easier

## Conclusion

F012 is **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**. Docker Compose orchestration is fully functional and tested. All acceptance criteria met. Sprint 00 (Foundation) is now **100% COMPLETE** - all 12 foundation cards done!

The development team can now run the entire stack locally with a single command: `docker compose up -d`
