## Technical Approach

**Report Query Optimization**:

```sql
-- Use materialized view for fast aggregation
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW stock_summary AS
SELECT
    warehouse_id,
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,
    COUNT(DISTINCT batch_id) AS batch_count
FROM stock_batches
GROUP BY warehouse_id, product_id;

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW stock_summary;  -- Daily cron
```

**Caching Strategy**:

- Report results cached 15 minutes
- Dashboard metrics cached 5 minutes
- Invalidate on stock_movement creation
