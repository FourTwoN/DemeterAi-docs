## Metadata

- **Epic**: epic-002-database-models
- **Sprint**: Sprint-01
- **Priority**: high
- **Complexity**: 1 points
- **Dependencies**: Blocks [DB017]

## Description

Product sizes enum. SQLAlchemy model following Clean Architecture patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Model created in app/models/product_size.py
- [x] All columns defined with correct types (code, name, description, min_height_cm, max_height_cm,
  sort_order)
- [x] Relationships configured with lazy loading strategy (COMMENTED OUT until models ready)
- [x] Alembic migration created (7 seed records)
- [x] Indexes added for code (UK) and sort_order
- [x] Unit tests â‰¥75% coverage (22 unit tests + 8 integration tests)

## Implementation Notes

See database/database.mmd ERD for complete schema.

## Testing

- Test model creation
- Test relationships
- Test constraints

## Handover

Standard SQLAlchemy model. Follow DB011-DB014 patterns.

## Team Leader Mini-Plan Linked

**Date**: 2025-10-14 15:30
**Status**: READY FOR PARALLEL EXECUTION with DB018

See detailed mini-plan:
`/home/lucasg/proyectos/DemeterDocs/backlog/03_kanban/02_in-progress/DB019-MINI-PLAN.md`

**Parallel Execution Strategy**:

- DB018 (ProductStates) + DB019 (ProductSizes) in SAME session
- Python Expert: Implement BOTH models (~45-60 min)
- Testing Expert: Write tests for BOTH (~45-60 min)
- Combined commit: feat(models): implement ProductState + ProductSize enums (DB018+DB019)

**Seed Data**:

- 7 size categories: XS (0-5cm), S (5-10cm), M (10-20cm), L (20-40cm), XL (40-80cm), XXL (80+cm),
  CUSTOM (no range)
- Height ranges nullable (CUSTOM has NULL for both min/max)
- sort_order for UI dropdowns (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 99)

**Estimated Time**: Part of 1-1.5 hour COMBINED session with DB018

**Next Step**: Move to `02_in-progress/` and spawn experts
