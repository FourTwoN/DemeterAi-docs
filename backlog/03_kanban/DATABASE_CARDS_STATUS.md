**Status**: Starting Sprint 01 execution
**Scrum Master**: Claude Code (AI Project Manager)
**Team Leader**: Available for delegation

#### Critical Path Strategy
Sprint 01 has 51 cards (28 models + 7 migrations + 28 repositories - 12 foundation overlap = 51 unique)

**Execution Order** (dependency-driven):
1. R027: Base Repository (BLOCKS all other repositories)
2. DB001-DB006: Location hierarchy models (foundation)
3. DB007-DB010: Stock management models
4. DB011-DB028: Remaining models (photo processing, products, config)
5. DB029-DB032: Alembic migrations (after all models complete)
6. R001-R026: Specialized repositories (after R027 + models)
7. R028: Repository Factory (final integration)

#### Moved to Ready Queue (2025-10-13 14:00)
- R027: Base Repository (CRITICAL - blocks all repos)
  - Priority: CRITICAL
  - Complexity: M (5 points)
  - Dependencies: F006 (complete)
  - Blocks: ALL repositories (R001-R026)

**Next Actions**:
- Delegate R027 to Team Leader IMMEDIATELY
- Prepare DB001-DB006 for next wave (location hierarchy)

**Commit**: 1605a8f
**Achievement**: UNBLOCKED 27 repository tasks (R001-R026, R028)

#### Sprint 01 Progress Update

**Completed** (13 cards, 65 points):
- Foundation (F001-F012): 12 cards, 60 points - SPRINT 00 COMPLETE
- R027: Base Repository: 1 card, 5 points - SPRINT 01 FIRST COMPLETION

**Next Wave: Database Models - Location Hierarchy (DB001-DB006)**
Priority: CRITICAL (Foundation for all spatial queries)

Cards moving to Ready Queue:
1. DB001: Warehouses Model (PostGIS Root) - 3pts, HIGH priority
2. DB002: StorageAreas Model (Level 2) - 2pts, HIGH priority
3. DB003: StorageLocations Model (Photo Unit) - 3pts, CRITICAL priority

- No blockers - F006 (database connection) is complete

**Dependencies Satisfied**:
- F006: Database connection manager (complete)
- F007: Alembic setup (complete)
- PostGIS extension available (part of F006)

**Blocks**:
- DB007-DB008: Stock movements/batches (need storage_bin_id FK)
- DB011-DB014: Photo processing (need storage_location_id FK)
- DB024: StorageLocationConfig (need storage_location_id FK)
- ALL repositories R001-R006 (need models to exist)

---

### Session 6: Delegate DB004 - Complete Geospatial Hierarchy (2025-10-13 16:35)

**Status**: DB003 validated, DB004 ready for delegation
**Next Card**: DB004 - StorageBin Model (FINAL level of hierarchy)

#### DB004 Task Analysis

**Priority**: HIGH (completes geospatial hierarchy to 100%)
**Complexity**: S (2 story points) - SIMPLEST MODEL YET
**Estimated Time**: 1-1.5 hours (faster than DB001-DB003)

**Why This Task Completes Sprint 01 Foundation**:
1. Finishes 4-level geospatial hierarchy (warehouse → area → location → bin)
2. Unblocks ALL stock management models (DB005-DB011)
3. Unblocks ALL photo processing models (DB012-DB014)
4. Simplest model yet (NO PostGIS, NO triggers, NO spatial validation)

**Dependencies Satisfied**:
- ✅ DB001: Warehouse model exists
- ✅ DB002: StorageArea model exists
- ✅ DB003: StorageLocation model exists (storage_location_id FK now available)
- ✅ DB005: StorageBinType card exists (will implement type AFTER bins)
- ✅ Test infrastructure ready (pytest + mypy + ruff working)

**Key Simplifications vs DB001-DB003**:
1. NO PostGIS geometry (bins inherit location from parent)
2. NO GENERATED columns (no area calculations)
3. NO spatial triggers (no geometry to validate)
4. NO GIST indexes (no spatial data)
5. ONLY B-tree indexes (code UK, FK relationships)

**Reusable Patterns from DB001-DB003**:
- Code validation (@validates, uppercase, format pattern)
- CASCADE FK relationships (from parent)
- RESTRICT FK relationships (to child types)
- Standard timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Active boolean flag
- JSONB metadata column (position_metadata from ML)

**Expected Deliverables**:
- app/models/storage_bin.py (simple model, ~200 lines)
- alembic/versions/XXXX_create_storage_bins.py (simple migration)
- tests/unit/models/test_storage_bin.py (20-25 unit tests)
- tests/integration/models/test_storage_bin_geospatial.py (10-15 integration tests)
- Git commit: feat(models): implement StorageBin model - complete geospatial hierarchy (DB004)

**Unblocked Tasks After DB004** (50% of remaining database):
- DB005-DB011: Stock management (7 models)
- DB012-DB014: Photo processing (3 models)
- R004: StorageBinRepository

**Sprint Velocity**:
- DB001: 3pts → 2.5 hours
- DB002: 2pts → 1.5 hours
- DB003: 3pts → 1.5 hours
- Average: ~1 hour per story point ✅

**DB004 Projection**: 2pts → 1-1.5 hours (simplest model)

#### Action: Moving DB004 to In-Progress (Ready for Team Leader)

**Next Step**: Delegate to Team Leader with full context below

### Next Wave Priority Strategy

**Phase 1: Reference Data Foundation** (DB005, DB006 already in Ready Queue)
- ✅ DB005: StorageBinTypes (1pt) - Reference catalog for bins
- ✅ DB006: Location Relationships (validation triggers, 3pts)

**Phase 2: Product Catalog Foundation** (5 models, ~10 points)
- DB015: ProductCategories (2pts) - ROOT of product hierarchy
- DB016: ProductFamilies (2pts) - Depends on DB015
- DB017: Products (3pts) - Depends on DB016
- DB018: ProductStates Enum (1pt) - Simple enum
- DB019: ProductSizes Enum (1pt) - Simple enum

**Phase 3: Photo Processing Pipeline** (4 models, ~12 points - CRITICAL PATH ⚡)
- DB011: S3Images (2pts) - UUID PK, BLOCKS ML pipeline
- DB012: PhotoProcessingSessions (3pts) - Depends on DB011 + DB003
- DB013: Detections (4pts) - Partitioned, depends on DB012
- DB014: Estimations (3pts) - Partitioned, depends on DB012 + DB013

**Phase 4: Stock Management** (4 models, ~8 points)
- DB009: MovementTypes Enum (1pt) - BLOCKS DB007
- DB010: BatchStatus Enum (1pt) - BLOCKS DB008
- DB007: StockMovements (3pts) - Depends on DB009
- DB008: StockBatches (3pts) - Depends on DB010

**Phase 5: Packaging + Config** (8 models, ~15 points)
- DB020-DB023: Packaging (4 models, 6pts)
- DB024-DB027: Config + Users (4 models, 9pts)

**Phase 6: Migrations** (7 cards, ~10 points)
- DB029-DB035: Alembic migrations (after all models complete)

### Immediate Actions (2025-10-14)

**Current Ready Queue**:
- ✅ DB005: StorageBinTypes (1pt, HIGH priority)
- ✅ DB006: Location Relationships (3pts, MEDIUM priority)

**Moving to Ready Queue NOW** (Phase 2: Product Catalog):
- DB015: ProductCategories (2pts, HIGH priority) - ROOT of product hierarchy
- DB016: ProductFamilies (2pts, HIGH priority) - Depends on DB015
- DB017: Products (3pts, HIGH priority) - Depends on DB016
- DB018: ProductStates Enum (1pt, HIGH priority) - Independent
- DB019: ProductSizes Enum (1pt, HIGH priority) - Independent

**Rationale**:
1. DB005 + DB006 complete the location infrastructure
2. Product catalog (DB015-DB019) is foundation for ALL stock + ML models
3. Once product catalog is done, can parallelize:
   - Photo processing pipeline (DB011-DB014)
   - Stock management (DB007-DB010)
   - Packaging (DB020-DB023)

**Delegation Order**:
1. DB005 (StorageBinTypes) - DELEGATE NOW (simplest, 1pt)
2. DB006 (Location Relationships) - After DB005 (triggers, 3pts)
3. DB015 (ProductCategories) - After DB006 (catalog root, 2pts)
4. DB018 (ProductStates Enum) - Parallel with DB015 (1pt)
5. DB019 (ProductSizes Enum) - Parallel with DB015 (1pt)
6. DB016 (ProductFamilies) - After DB015 (2pts)
7. DB017 (Products) - After DB016 (3pts)

**Expected Timeline**:
- Phase 1 (DB005-DB006): 4 hours (~4 points)
- Phase 2 (DB015-DB019): 5 hours (~10 points)
- **Total for next 2 phases**: 9 hours (2 work days)

### DB005 Delegation (2025-10-14 10:30)

**Task**: DB005 - StorageBinTypes Model (Container Type Catalog)
**Priority**: HIGH (reference data foundation)
**Complexity**: S (1 story point)
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

**Status**: DELEGATED to Team Leader
**Location**: Moved from 00_backlog/ → 01_ready/
**Delegation Section**: Added complete context to task file

**Why DB005 Next**:
1. Simplest model after geospatial hierarchy (no PostGIS, no triggers)
2. Reference/catalog table with seed data (plug trays, boxes, segments)
3. Blocks DB025 (DensityParameters for ML estimation)
4. Pattern will be reused for DB015-DB019 (Product Catalog)

**Current Ready Queue** (8 tasks):
1. DB005: StorageBinTypes (1pt) - DELEGATED NOW
2. DB006: Location Relationships (3pts) - Next after DB005
3. DB015: ProductCategories (2pts) - Product catalog root
4. DB016: ProductFamilies (2pts) - Depends on DB015
5. DB017: Products (3pts) - Depends on DB016
6. DB018: ProductStates Enum (1pt) - Independent
7. DB019: ProductSizes Enum (1pt) - Independent
8. DB004-mini-plan.md (planning artifact)

**Next Actions**:
1. Team Leader uses /start-task DB005
2. Track progress through Kanban pipeline (in_progress → code_review → testing → done)
3. Upon completion, delegate DB006 (Location Relationships, 3pts)
4. After DB006, move to Product Catalog wave (DB015-DB019, 10pts total)

**Sprint Velocity Projection**:
- Current: 2 points/hour (EXCELLENT)
- DB005: 1pt → 30-45 min (projected)
- Remaining Sprint 01: 46 cards, ~68 points → 34 hours (~4-5 work days)

### DB018 Delegation (2025-10-14 11:15)

**Task**: DB018 - ProductStates Enum (Product Lifecycle States)
**Priority**: HIGH (Product Catalog foundation - CRITICAL PATH)
**Complexity**: S (1 story point)
**Estimated Time**: 30-40 minutes

**Status**: DELEGATED to Team Leader
**Location**: Moved from 01_ready/ → 02_in-progress/

**Why DB018 First**:
1. Simplest Product Catalog task (reference table with 11 lifecycle states)
2. Blocks DB017 (Products model needs product_state_id FK)
3. Establishes pattern for DB015-DB019 (Product Catalog wave)
4. Can be done in parallel with DB019 (ProductSizes Enum)

**Current Ready Queue** (7 tasks):
1. DB018: ProductStates Enum (1pt) - DELEGATED NOW
2. DB019: ProductSizes Enum (1pt) - Can start in parallel
3. DB006: Location Relationships (3pts) - After enums
4. DB015: ProductCategories (2pts) - Product catalog root
5. DB016: ProductFamilies (2pts) - Depends on DB015
6. DB017: Products (3pts) - Depends on DB015+DB016+DB018+DB019
7. DB004-mini-plan.md (planning artifact)

**Product Catalog Dependency Chain**:
- DB018 ProductStates Enum → DB017 Products (FK)
- DB019 ProductSizes Enum → DB017 Products (FK)
- DB015 ProductCategories → DB016 ProductFamilies (FK) → DB017 Products (FK)
- After DB015-DB019 complete → DB017 can start (main Products model)

**Parallel Work Strategy**:
- DB018 (ProductStates) and DB019 (ProductSizes) are independent enums
- Both can be implemented simultaneously by Team Leader
- After both complete, start DB015 (ProductCategories root)

**Sprint Velocity Projection**:
- Current: ~1.5 hours per story point (excellent)
- DB018: 1pt → 30-40 min (projected)
- DB019: 1pt → 30-40 min (projected)
- Both enums: ~2 pts → 1-1.5 hours total
- Remaining Product Catalog (DB015-DB017): 7 pts → 10-12 hours

**Sprint Context**:
- Completed: 18 cards (79 points)
- In Progress: 1 card (DB018, 1 point)
- Remaining: 44 cards (~66 points)
- Estimated Completion: 44 hours (~5-6 work days at current velocity)
