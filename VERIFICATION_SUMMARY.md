## Production Readiness Assessment

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Code Quality** | ‚úÖ READY | All app code pre-commit checks pass |
| **Tests** | ‚ùå NOT READY | 18% failure rate - must be 0% |
| **Type Checking** | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK | 275 mypy errors - should be 0 |
| **Architecture** | ‚úÖ GOOD | Clean architecture properly implemented |
| **Database** | ‚ö†Ô∏è TBD | Schema matches ERD, needs test verification |
| **Auth** | ‚ùå NEEDS FIX | Tests failing, configuration incomplete |
| **ML Pipeline** | ‚ùå NEEDS FIX | Models not loading, dependencies incomplete |
| **Storage** | ‚ùå NEEDS FIX | S3 integration not configured for tests |
| **Documentation** | ‚úÖ GOOD | Architecture and flows well documented |

**Overall**: üî¥ **NOT PRODUCTION READY** - Critical issues must be fixed first

## Estimated Timeline to Production

| Task | Effort | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Fix database session setup | 4-6h | P0 |
| Fix auth configuration | 2-3h | P0 |
| Fix S3 integration | 1-2h | P0 |
| Fix ML pipeline setup | 2-4h | P0 |
| Fix type checking (mypy) | 2-3h | P1 |

## Questions to Address

1. **Why are model tests failing?**
   - Are they database session issues?
   - Or model/schema mismatches?
   - ‚Üí Check conftest.py setup

2. **Is test database running?**
   - Is docker compose up?
   - Are migrations applied?
   - ‚Üí Verify: `docker compose ps && alembic current`

3. **Are Auth0 credentials set in tests?**
   - Are environment variables configured?
   - Or should we mock Auth0?
   - ‚Üí Check: `echo $AUTH0_DOMAIN`

4. **Are ML models available?**
   - Is YOLO v11 cache populated?
   - Are dependencies installed?
   - ‚Üí Check: `ls -la ~/.cache/ultralytics/`

5. **Is S3 configured for tests?**
   - Is Minio running?
   - Are connection strings correct?
   - ‚Üí Check: test environment variables
