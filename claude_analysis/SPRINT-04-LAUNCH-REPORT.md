## üéØ SPRINT GOALS PROGRESS

| Goal | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| All API endpoints implemented | üîÑ In Progress | Schemas ready, controllers waiting for services |
| Celery async processing working | ‚úÖ STARTED | CEL001 complete, CEL002-003 queued |
| POST /api/stock/photo triggers ML | üîÑ In Progress | Services being implemented, Celery ready |
| GET /api/stock/tasks/{task_id} works | üîÑ In Progress | Task tracking configured in Celery |
| Pydantic schemas complete | üîÑ In Progress | Base schemas ready, domain schemas pending |
| Authentication working | üìã Planned | Not started (lower priority Wave 2) |
| OpenAPI docs at /docs | üìã Planned | Will auto-generate from schemas + controllers |
| Integration tests pass | üîÑ In Progress | Test suite being created |

---

## üìà VELOCITY PROJECTION

### Early Metrics
- **Time to CEL001 complete**: 6.5 hours (from kickoff)
- **Time to S015 complete**: 8+ hours (implementation done, testing pending)
- **Parallel execution efficiency**: 4 teams simultaneous = 4x speedup vs sequential

### Projected Sprint Completion
**Dual-Track Strategy**:
- Week 1: Photo services + Celery infrastructure + schemas (all parallel)
- Week 2: Product services + remaining ML services
- Week 3: Controllers (dependency clear)
- **Expected**: 60-70% Sprint 04 complete by Day 10

**If Sequential** (not recommended):
- Weeks 1-2: All Sprint 03 remaining services (80 hours)
- Weeks 3-4: Sprint 04 only
- **Result**: 30% Sprint 04 complete by Day 10

## üö® CRITICAL PATH & BLOCKERS

### Immediate Blockers (TODAY)
None - all 4 priority teams can start immediately

### 24-Hour Blockers (Tomorrow)
1. Photo services (S013-S017) need to complete for ML controllers
2. Product services (S019-S021) need S021 completion
3. Celery infrastructure (CEL002-003) needed for ML task integration

### Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Photo services delayed | MEDIUM | CRITICAL | Start CEL001-003 first (done), they're independent |
| ML services blocked | HIGH | HIGH | Start controllers in parallel (locations) |
| Test coverage fails | LOW | MEDIUM | Real DB testing + comprehensive test suite |
| Celery Redis issues | LOW | CRITICAL | Docker already has Redis running |
