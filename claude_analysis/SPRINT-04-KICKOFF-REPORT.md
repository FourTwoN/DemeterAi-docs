**All tasks in backlog** (`00_backlog/`):
- C001-C026: API endpoints

**Dependency Analysis**:
- **Can Start Immediately** (Location controllers - services complete):
  - C011: GET /api/locations/warehouses (3pts)
  - C012: GET /api/locations/warehouses/{id} (3pts) [assuming C011-C012 are warehouse endpoints]

- **Blocked by Product Services** (S013-S018):
  - C013-C017: Product/catalog endpoints

**All tasks in backlog** (`00_backlog/`):
- SCH001-SCH027: Pydantic schemas

**Dependency Analysis**:
- **Can Start Immediately** (only need database models - ALL COMPLETE):

  - SCH002: Error response schemas (2pts)
  - SCH003: Enum schemas (MovementType, WarehouseType, ProductState) (3pts)

  - SCH013-SCH016: Product schemas - need S013-S018
  - SCH024-SCH025: Config schemas - need S028-S030

---

## 4. Sprint 04 Kickoff Strategy

### OPTION A: Sequential Approach (NOT RECOMMENDED)
Complete ALL Sprint 03 services (32 cards, ~160 points) before starting Sprint 04.
- **Timeline**: 80 hours (10 work days) at 2 pts/hour velocity
- **Risk**: Sprint 04 delayed significantly
- **Pros**: Clean sprint boundaries, no context switching
- **Cons**: Frontend team blocked, API documentation delayed

### OPTION B: Dual-Track Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Track 1: Complete Critical Sprint 03 Services** (Priority)
Focus on services that BLOCK Sprint 04 critical path:

**Wave 1: Photo Services** (5 services, 25 points) - 12 hours
- S023-S027: Photo pipeline services
- **Unblocks**: C001 (photo upload), CEL006 (ML parent task)

**Wave 2: Product Services** (6 services, 15 points) - 8 hours
- S013-S018: Product catalog services
- **Unblocks**: C013-C017 (product endpoints), SCH013-SCH016 (product schemas)

**Wave 3: ML Pipeline Services** (9 services, 60 points) - 30 hours
- S031-S039: ML orchestration
- **Unblocks**: CEL006-CEL008 (Celery ML tasks)

**Wave 4: Configuration Services** (3 services, 15 points) - 8 hours
- S028-S030: Config management
- **Unblocks**: C018-C021 (config endpoints)

**Total**: 58 hours (~7 work days)

**Track 2: Start Sprint 04 Zero-Dependency Tasks** (Parallel)

**Immediate Start** (Day 1):
1. SCH001: Base schemas (3pts) - 1.5 hours
2. SCH002: Error schemas (2pts) - 1 hour
3. SCH003: Enum schemas (3pts) - 1.5 hours
4. CEL001: GPU worker config (5pts) - 2.5 hours
5. CEL002: CPU worker config (3pts) - 1.5 hours
6. CEL003: I/O worker config (3pts) - 1.5 hours

**Total Day 1**: 19 points, ~10 hours (parallel with Wave 1 Sprint 03)

**After Location Schemas** (Day 2-3):
7. SCH009-SCH012: Location schemas (9pts) - 4.5 hours
8. C011-C012: Location endpoints (6pts) - 3 hours [if these are warehouse endpoints]

**After Wave 1 Complete** (Photo Services Done - Day 4):
9. SCH017-SCH020: Photo/ML schemas (10pts)
10. C001: POST /api/stock/photo (5pts)

**Progressive Unblocking**: As each Sprint 03 wave completes, immediately start dependent Sprint 04 tasks.

| CEL001-CEL005 | NONE (infrastructure) | 15 | ✅ YES |
| C011-C012 | S001-S006 (COMPLETE) | 6 | ✅ YES |
| C001 | S023-S027 (Photo) | 5 | ❌ BLOCKED |
| CEL006-CEL008 | S031-S039 (ML) | 20 | ❌ BLOCKED |
| C013-C017 | S013-S018 (Product) | 15 | ❌ BLOCKED |
| SCH017-SCH020 | S023-S027, S031-S039 | 10 | ❌ BLOCKED |

**Zero-Dependency Tasks**: 38 points (19% of Sprint 04)

## 6. Recommended Action Plan

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today - 2025-10-21)

**Step 1: Move Zero-Dependency Sprint 04 Tasks to Ready Queue**
```bash

---

## 7. Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK

**ML Services Bottleneck** (S031-S039, 60 points)
- **Impact**: Blocks CEL006-CEL008 (core Celery tasks for ML pipeline)
- **Timeline**: 30 hours (4 work days)
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize S031 (PipelineCoordinatorService) first - unblocks architecture understanding
- **Status**: CRITICAL PATH for end-to-end photo → ML → results workflow

**Photo Services Dependency** (S023-S027, 25 points)
- **Impact**: Blocks C001 (main photo upload endpoint)
- **Timeline**: 12 hours (1.5 work days)
- **Mitigation**: Started in Week 1 Day 1
- **Status**: MANAGEABLE

### MEDIUM RISK

**Product Services Delay** (S013-S018, 15 points)
- **Impact**: Blocks C013-C017 (product endpoints), SCH013-SCH016 (product schemas)
- **Timeline**: 8 hours (1 work day)
- **Mitigation**: Start in Week 1 Day 3 (after photo services)
- **Status**: ACCEPTABLE

**Schema Dependencies on Services**
- **Impact**: Some schemas (SCH017-SCH020) can't be finalized until services exist
- **Mitigation**: Implement base schemas first, iterate as services complete
- **Status**: EXPECTED - normal iterative development

### LOW RISK

**Celery Infrastructure** (CEL001-CEL005)
- **Impact**: None - no service dependencies
- **Timeline**: 8 hours (1 work day)
- **Mitigation**: Start immediately
- **Status**: READY TO EXECUTE

**Location Controllers** (C011-C012)
- **Impact**: None - services S001-S006 complete
- **Timeline**: 3 hours
- **Mitigation**: Start after location schemas complete
- **Status**: READY AFTER SCH009-SCH012

---

## 8. Success Metrics

### Sprint 04 Completion Criteria

**Minimum Viable Sprint 04** (60% completion target):
- ✅ All Celery infrastructure (CEL001-CEL005) - 15 points
- ✅ Base schemas (SCH001-SCH003) - 8 points

- ✅ Photo upload workflow (S023-S027, SCH017-SCH019, C001) - 38 points
- ✅ ML task orchestration (CEL006-CEL008) - 20 points
- **Total**: 96 points / 230 Sprint 04 points = 42% (ACHIEVABLE in 2 weeks)

**Full Sprint 04** (100% completion target):
- All 54 Sprint 04 cards: 230 points
- **Requires**: ALL Sprint 03 services complete (32 cards, 160 points)

- ✅ Celery workers start successfully
- ✅ End-to-end workflow: Photo upload → ML processing → Results retrieval

---

## 9. Recommendations

### FOR PRODUCT OWNER

**Decision Required**: Choose between:
1. **Strict Sprint Boundaries**: Complete Sprint 03 fully before Sprint 04 (10 work days delay)
2. **Dual-Track Approach**: Start Sprint 04 zero-dependency tasks immediately (RECOMMENDED)

**Recommended**: DUAL-TRACK APPROACH
- **Pros**: Faster time-to-market, unblocks frontend team, demonstrates progress
- **Cons**: More context switching, complex dependency tracking
- **Mitigation**: Scrum Master manages dependency graph, clear handoffs

### FOR TEAM LEADERS

**Week 1 Focus**:
1. **Photo Services** (S023-S027) - Highest priority, blocks C001
2. **Base Schemas** (SCH001-SCH003) - Foundation for all API work
3. **Celery Infrastructure** (CEL001-CEL005) - Independent work stream

**Week 2 Focus**:
1. **Product Services** (S013-S018) - Unblocks product endpoints
2. **Photo Schemas + Controller** (SCH017-SCH020, C001)
3. **Location Controllers** (C011-C012)

**Week 3+ Focus**:
1. **ML Services** (S031-S039) - CRITICAL PATH
2. **ML Celery Tasks** (CEL006-CEL008)
3. **Remaining Controllers** (C002-C026)

### FOR SCRUM MASTER (Me)

**Immediate Actions**:
1. ✅ Move 12 zero-dependency Sprint 04 tasks to `01_ready/`
2. ✅ Move 5 Wave 1 Sprint 03 services to `01_ready/`
3. ✅ Update DATABASE_CARDS_STATUS.md with dual-track plan
4. ✅ Create Sprint 04 dependency matrix (track unblocking)
5. ✅ Monitor parallel workstreams (prevent bottlenecks)

**Daily Standup Questions**:
- Which Sprint 03 services completed today? (update unblocking matrix)
- Which Sprint 04 tasks can now start? (move to ready queue)
- Are there any new blockers? (add to `06_blocked/`)

---

## 10. Summary

**Current State**:
- Sprint 03: 23.8% complete (10/42 services)
- Sprint 04: 0% complete (54 tasks in backlog)
- **Blockers**: 32 Sprint 03 services blocking 81% of Sprint 04

**Recommended Approach**: DUAL-TRACK
- **Track 1**: Complete Sprint 03 critical path (23 services, 115 points) - 58 hours
- **Track 2**: Start Sprint 04 zero-dependency tasks (12 tasks, 38 points) - 19 hours

**Timeline**:
- **Week 1**: Photo services + Base schemas + Celery infra
- **Week 2**: Product services + Photo endpoints + Location endpoints
- **Week 3-4**: ML services + ML Celery tasks + Remaining controllers

**Expected Sprint 04 Completion**: 60% (Minimum Viable) by end of Week 2, 100% (Full) by end of Week 4

**Next Steps**:
1. Product Owner approves dual-track approach
2. Scrum Master moves 17 tasks to ready queue (12 Sprint 04 + 5 Sprint 03)
3. Team Leaders start parallel execution (3 teams, 3 tasks simultaneously)
