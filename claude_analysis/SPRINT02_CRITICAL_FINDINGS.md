# SPRINT 02 - CRITICAL FINDINGS REPORT

## Problem Statement

Sprint 02 (ML Pipeline & Repositories) has strong code architecture but is **BLOCKED** by test infrastructure issues and algorithm accuracy problems.

---

## Critical Issue #1: Database Schema Not Initialized (BLOCKER)

### Severity: üö® CRITICAL

### Evidence
- 292 test collection/setup errors
- Error message: `asyncpg.exceptions.UndefinedColumnError: column "id" referenced in foreign key constraint does not exist`
- Affects: All repository and integration tests

### Root Cause
Database migrations have NOT been applied to the test database. When tests try to create tables, they fail due to missing foreign key column references.

### Proof
```
ERROR at setup of test_create_record
asyncpg.exceptions.UndefinedColumnError: column "id" referenced in foreign key
constraint does not exist
```

### Impact
- ‚ùå Cannot run ANY repository tests
- ‚ùå Cannot run ANY integration tests
- ‚ùå Cannot verify data access layer
- ‚ùå **BLOCKS Sprint 03** (depends on working tests)

### Fix
```bash
# Apply all pending migrations to test database
cd /home/lucasg/proyectos/DemeterDocs
alembic upgrade head

# Verify migration
alembic current
```

### Verification
After applying migrations, re-run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/repositories/ -v
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

## Critical Issue #2: Band Estimation Algorithm Accuracy (BLOCKER)

### Severity: ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH

### Test Details
- File: `tests/integration/ml_processing/test_band_estimation_integration.py`
- Test: `TestBandEstimationAccuracy::test_estimation_accuracy_within_10_percent`
- Status: ‚ùå FAILING

### Failure Details
```
AssertionError: Error rate 398.3% exceeds 10%.
Estimated: 2865, Ground truth: 575
assert 3.982608695652174 < 0.1
```

### Analysis

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Detected plants | 565 | ‚úÖ OK |
| Estimated plants (4 bands) | 2,300 | ‚ùå MASSIVELY HIGH |
| Total (detected + estimated) | 2,865 | ‚ùå WRONG |
| Ground truth | 575 | - |
| Error rate | 398.3% | ‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE |
| Target error rate | <10% | - |

### Root Cause
The band estimation algorithm is **massively overestimating**. It's predicting ~5x more plants than actually present.

Possible causes:
1. `alpha_overcount` parameter (0.9) too high
2. Band detection threshold too low
3. Area calculations incorrect
4. Plant size estimation off

### Algorithm Output
```
Band 1: estimated 644 plants (avg_area=576px, processed=333810px)
Band 2: estimated 804 plants (avg_area=576px, processed=416663px)
Band 3: estimated 420 plants (avg_area=900px, processed=340095px)
Band 4: estimated 432 plants (avg_area=900px, processed=349143px)
Total: 2,300 estimated plants
```

### Code Location
- Service: `app/services/ml_processing/band_estimation_service.py`
- Method: `estimate_undetected_plants()`
- Parameters: `alpha_overcount=0.9`, `num_bands=4`

### Fix Strategy
1. **Calibrate alpha_overcount**: Reduce from 0.9 to 0.7-0.8
2. **Adjust band detection threshold**: Increase confidence requirement
3. **Review area calculations**: Verify plant footprint estimation
4. **Test with different datasets**: Validate across multiple scenarios

### Verification
After tuning parameters:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/ml_processing/test_band_estimation_integration.py -v

# Should show: Error rate < 0.10 (10% acceptable)
```

## Critical Issue #3: Test Coverage Below Threshold

### Severity: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM (Blocker for quality gate)

### Evidence
```
Coverage failure: total of 49 is less than fail-under=80
```

### Coverage Breakdown
- Current: 49.74%
- Required: 80%
- Gap: 30.26% (SIGNIFICANT)

### Files with Poorest Coverage
| File | Coverage | Gap |
|------|----------|-----|
| app/services/storage_area_service.py | 16% | 64% |
| app/services/warehouse_service.py | 17% | 63% |
| app/services/storage_location_service.py | 18% | 62% |
| app/services/storage_bin_service.py | 33% | 47% |
| app/tasks/ml_tasks.py | 20% | 60% |

### Root Cause
Services have business logic that's not covered by tests:
- Create/update/delete operations (untested)
- Validation logic (untested)
- Error handling paths (untested)
- Complex workflows (untested)

### Impact
- ‚ùå Cannot mark sprint complete
- ‚ùå Cannot proceed to Sprint 03
- ‚ùå Quality gate blocks deployment

### Fix Strategy
1. **Service tests**: Add unit tests for all business logic
2. **Integration tests**: Test database interactions
3. **Error paths**: Test exception handling
4. **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions

### Target Coverage by Component
- Services: 85%+
- Repositories: 95%+ (already high)
- Models: 90%+
- ML pipeline: 80%+

---

## Secondary Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Issue 4: Test Organization
Some tests are not using real database (lower priority):
- Location: `tests/unit/schemas/` - These CAN use mocks (not business logic)
- Status: ‚úÖ Acceptable (schemas don't have complex logic)

### Issue 5: Model Tests
Some model tests showing errors (dependent on Issue #1 fix):
- Tests: `test_product_size.py`, `test_product_state.py`
- Status: Will be fixed by database migration

---

## CLAUDE.MD Rule Violations

### Rule 2: Tests Must ACTUALLY Pass ‚ùå
**Status**: VIOLATED
- Current pass rate: 70.8%
- Required: 100%
- Blocker: Database schema (Issue #1)

### Rule 4: Quality Gates Are Mandatory ‚ùå
**Status**: PARTIALLY VIOLATED
- Coverage: FAILED (49% < 80%)
- Tests pass: FAILED (86 failed, 292 errors)
- No hallucinations: PASSED ‚úÖ
- Models match schema: UNCERTAIN (will verify after Issue #1)

## Action Plan (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE (Today)
1. [ ] Apply database migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
2. [ ] Re-run full test suite
3. [ ] Document results

### TODAY (If time permits)
4. [ ] Identify remaining test failures
5. [ ] Create list of services needing additional tests

### THIS SPRINT
6. [ ] Calibrate band estimation algorithm
7. [ ] Add integration tests for services (target 80% coverage)
8. [ ] Fix remaining test failures

### BEFORE SPRINT 03
9. [ ] Verify all tests passing (100%)
10. [ ] Verify coverage at 80%+
11. [ ] Perform code review of issue fixes
12. [ ] Get approval to proceed

---

## Success Criteria

**Must achieve BEFORE moving to Sprint 03**:
- [ ] All tests passing (0 failures, 0 errors)
- [ ] Coverage ‚â• 80%
- [ ] Band estimation accuracy < 10% error
- [ ] Database schema fully initialized
- [ ] All quality gates passing

**Current status**: ‚ùå NOT READY (0/5 criteria met)
