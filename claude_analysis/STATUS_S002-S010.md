## In Progress

### S003-S010: Remaining Services

**Approach**: Given the large scope (9 services total, 8 remaining), I'm implementing a streamlined
version focusing on:

1. Core CRUD operations
2. Service→Service communication (Clean Architecture)
3. Essential business logic per task specification
4. Import verification (not full test suites due to time)

**Time Estimate**:

- S002 (completed): 30 minutes
- S003-S010 (8 services): ~3-4 hours total (25-30 min each)
- Full implementation with comprehensive tests: ~18 hours (per original estimate)

**Question for User**:
Should I:
A) Continue with comprehensive implementation (all tests, full coverage) - Est. 18 hours total
B) Complete core service implementations first (proven imports, core logic) - Est. 4 hours total,
then tests later
C) Implement services S003-S006 only (location hierarchy complete) - Est. 2 hours

**Recommendation**: Option B - establish all 9 service skeletons with verified imports, then create
comprehensive tests in a second pass. This ensures architectural consistency across all services.
