## Critical Gaps (Blocking Implementation)

### Tier 1: Must Have (Days 1-2)

**1. S3 Upload with Circuit Breaker**

- Impact: Photo uploads fail without resilience
- Blocking: ML Pipeline entire workflow
- Tasks: 2-3
- Effort: 8 hours

**2. Classification Service**

- Impact: Cannot link detections to products
- Blocking: SAHI + Boxes workflows
- Tasks: 1-2
- Effort: 4-8 hours

**3. Aggregation Service**

- Impact: ML results cannot be converted to stock batches
- Blocking: Callback + entire pipeline conclusion
- Tasks: 2-3
- Effort: 8 hours

**4. Geolocation Service**

- Impact: Photos cannot be assigned to locations
- Blocking: ML Parent segmentation workflow
- Tasks: 1
- Effort: 4 hours

**Subtotal**: 6-9 tasks, ~1.5 days effort

- StockMovementService: +3 methods (validate, link_to_batch, get_by_session)
- Tasks: 2
- Effort: 8 hours

**Subtotal**: 5-7 tasks, ~1 day effort

---

### Tier 3: Medium Priority (Days 5-6)

**8. BulkOperationService**

- Impact: Cannot perform admin bulk operations
- Blocking: Bulk edit workflows
- Tasks: 1-2
- Effort: 4-8 hours

**9. ExportService**

- Impact: Cannot export data/reports
- Blocking: Export workflows
- Tasks: 1-2
- Effort: 8-12 hours

**Subtotal**: 2-4 tasks, ~1 day effort

## Risk Analysis

### Critical Risks

| Risk                              | Probability | Impact                    | Mitigation                            |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| S3 circuit breaker incomplete     | High        | Pipeline fails under load | Implement battle-tested pattern       |
| ML callback aggregation lost data | Medium      | Stock counts incorrect    | Comprehensive verification + rollback |
| Transfer service race conditions  | Medium      | Inventory corruption      | Database locks + validation           |
| Geolocation wrong assignment      | Medium      | Wrong stock location      | Warning states + manual override      |

### Recovery Strategies

- Fallback to manual S3 uploads if circuit breaker fails
- Warning states instead of hard failures for location/config missing
- Comprehensive verification before any database writes
- Partial rollback capability for failed operations

**Estimated Effort**: 9-12 tasks, ~3 days
**Deliverables**:

- Working ML pipeline end-to-end
- Stock transfer operations
- Comprehensive testing & verification

### Can Defer to Sprint 04

- Tier 2c: DeathService (nice-to-have)
- Tier 3: BulkOperationService
- Tier 3: ExportService
- All frontend controllers

    - Schedule pair programming sessions

2. **This Week** (Days 1-3):
    - Implement S3Upload + ClassificationService
    - Test ML pipeline with real Celery workers
