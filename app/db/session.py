"""Database session management with async SQLAlchemy.

This module provides async database connection management using SQLAlchemy 2.0
with connection pooling, health checks, and FastAPI dependency injection.

Key features:
- Async engine with asyncpg driver (350x faster bulk inserts than sync ORM)
- Connection pooling (pool_size=20, max_overflow=10)
- FastAPI dependency for automatic session lifecycle management
- Health check function for monitoring database connectivity
- Proper transaction management (auto-commit/rollback)
